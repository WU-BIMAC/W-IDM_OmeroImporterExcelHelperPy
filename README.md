# W-IDM_OmeroImporterExcelHelperPy
The OMERO Importer Python tool was developed at **UMass Chan Medical School** and in collaboration with the **[Canada BioImaging](https://www.canadabioimaging.org)** Open Science Project for use with the Canada BioImaging [National OMERO Image Data Resource](https://omero.med.ualberta.ca/index/).

Its purpose is to create a list of Image data files and associated Tag annotations to be imported into OMERO using the [OmeroImporterPy](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/W-IDM_OmeroImporterPy) tool. It automatically explores a target directory tree containing image data files to extract the name of the files and the name of the nested directories containing the files. The OMERO Importer Python Excel Helper tool is designed to be embedded in an Excel macro.
